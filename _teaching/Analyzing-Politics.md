[Spring 2023 Syllabus](http://jasonyuyanwu.github.io/files/Analyzing-Politics-Syllabus-2023.pdf)


This course focuses on the question of how political science is done. We will walk through the frameworks guiding our thinking about politics and review descriptive, experimental, and observational approaches to research. Students will learn how to evaluate normative and empirical claims and practice constructing research questions and hypotheses. We will also consider the challenges of interpreting data and making inferences about politics.
