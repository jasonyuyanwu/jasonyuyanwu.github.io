[Fall 2024 Syllabus](http://jasonyuyanwu.github.io/files/Comparative-Politics-Approaches-Issues-Syllabus-2024.pdf)


This course provides an overview of the methods, approaches, and issues of comparative politics. We will discuss several of the substantive themes of the subfield, such as institutions, identity, behavior, and violence. The goal is to provide the background and training necessary for students to both prepare for the comprehensive exam and undertake original research.
