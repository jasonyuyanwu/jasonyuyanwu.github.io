[Spring 2025 Syllabus](http://jasonyuyanwu.github.io/files/Intro-Comparative-Syllabus-2025.pdf)


This course will introduce students to comparative politics â€“ the study of domestic political institutions, processes, behavior, and outcomes across and within countries. We will study concepts such as democracy and autocracy, political and electoral institutions, political violence, and identity. Cases will be drawn from around the world to give students a grounding in the method of comparative analysis. This course is recommended for those thinking about a major or minor in political science and for anyone interested in learning more about the politics of developed and developing countries.
