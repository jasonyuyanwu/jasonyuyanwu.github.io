[Spring 2025 Syllabus](http://jasonyuyanwu.github.io/files/Political-Behavior-Around-the-World-Syllabus-2025.pdf)


This seminar provides an introduction to some of the major themes in political behavior, including partisanship, elections, political attitudes, information, ideology, participation, and the role of the mass media in shaping the public's political beliefs and orientations. We will consider how well our theories explain political outcomes in both democracies and autocracies.
